# 5G Edge Integrations
Project repository for ongoing public integration efforts with infrastructure tools and services on Verizon 5G Edge.


## Background

We want to make it easier than ever to develop applications for the network edge. To that end, we've kicking off a number of open source projects to ensure that Verizon 5G Edge is supported across a variety of best-in-class software tools. Examples of ongoing projects include:

 - **{Private Redis Enterprise Cluster}**: Highly available cluster in Wavelength Zone with DNS (private hosted Zone)
  - **{Custom Terraform Provider for Edge Discovery}**: Automation of edge discovery service registry creation using Terraform custom provider
